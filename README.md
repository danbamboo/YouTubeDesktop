A desktop app built on [Electron](http://electron.atom.io) that interfaces with YouTube's API to provide a native-feeling watching experience powered by Google's Material Design language. This project is in no way associated with Google, and I am receiving no profit from this whatsoever.

This app is currently in development, but feel free to clone this repo and try it out. Please create a pull request if you fix or improve anything.

    $ git clone https://github.com/rittbys/YouTubeDesktop.git && cd YouTubeDesktop
    $ npm install && npm start
